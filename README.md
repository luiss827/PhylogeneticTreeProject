# PhylogeneticTreeProject
The repository includes scripts to simulate the evolution of DNA sequences over generations, allowing for the study of genetic mutations and speciation events. It also implements UPGMA and Neighbor-Joining algorithms, which are used to construct phylogenetic trees from distance matrices.

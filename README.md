# PhylogeneticTreeProject
This repository offers a hands-on approach to understanding how genetic sequences evolve over time, incorporating mechanisms for mutation and speciation. By simulating these processes, users can observe the dynamic changes in DNA sequences across generations.

The project also includes robust implementations of two key algorithms in bioinformatics: UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) and Neighbor-Joining. These algorithms are pivotal for constructing phylogenetic trees, which visually represent the evolutionary relationships and distances between different species based on their genetic data.

Developed as part of a Bachelorâ€™s degree coursework in Bioinformatics, this project not only serves as an educational tool but also demonstrates the practical application of computational techniques in the field of evolutionary biology. It is ideal for students and researchers interested in bioinformatics, genetics, and computational biology, providing a clear example of how programming can be used to solve complex biological problems and gain insights into the evolutionary processes that shape the diversity of life.
